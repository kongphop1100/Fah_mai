"""Doc-researcher prompt.

FIX #2 (defer to SQL): if a sub-question wants a value / id / number / amount / schema, it is NOT
in the documents — say so in one line and STOP, do not search. The chat corpus is full of synthetic
near-duplicate variants, so cap searches hard and never loop.

    "count / a table's schema or columns (e.g. an invoice id, payment_id, a THB figure, a policy "
    "value) — that lives in DATABASE TABLES, not in documents. Reply EXACTLY one line: 'out of scope "
